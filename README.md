# PyChess
Implementing chess in Python as an exercise in classes and collaboration via Git.
Practice project to keep my skills sharp.
- pyChess.py: Driver code + utility functions
- piece.py:   Parent class for all chess pieces
- pieces.py:  Child classes for each chess piece (all inherit from Piece)
